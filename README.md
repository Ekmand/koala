<h1 align="center">Koala Code Editor</h1>
<p align="center">üñ•Ô∏è Koala is a web-based, open source code editor for the Ideoxan Website.</p>

## About
This repository features the OSS version of the Koala editor that is used on the Ideoxan Website for lesson completion and course activities. Often times, the phrases "Ideoxan Editor" and "Koala" are used interchangably. Koala is simply just a nickname/codeword for the Ideoxan editor and is only used for this repository.

Internally, Koala uses the [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/) to power the code editor. From there, multiple other libraries are used for rendering the viewport, rendering the lesson guides, saving the data to your accounts, and completing a course.

## Release schedule
The release schedule for Koala is simple. The `main` branch is considered the bleeding edge of the release cycle and includes all changes to the codebase. These changes are then individually reviewed and pushed to the `prod` branch every month which is then synced with the [main repository](https://github.com/ideoxan/ideoxan).
